Accidentally I submitted my project solution without the following text for the reviewer.

Once again in this ND there is any inconsistency between the course material and the final project. 
Again there is a topic in the project that was not covered during the course, namely, event hubs.
I assume that there were some changes in the course material but the project was not updated, 
I can see that also from commented code that it is not relevant anymore.
However, in order for me to be sure that I did not miss anything in the project's requirements, 
I assumed that instead of event hubs you are referring to the event grid that is indeed covered during the course, 
so I implemented accordingly the relevant function handler.

Thanks for teh understanding!
